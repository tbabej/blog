Hello! Lovely to have you on my blog.

I am a curious person with passion for computer science, math and physics. Currently my interests span machine learning, quantum computing and their intersection - quantum machine learning.

Currently I act as the CTO, Researcher & Developer for our startup company ProteinQure. Before that I was busy with completing my studies and working as software engineer for Red Hat.

As my interests evolved, so did my backgroud. I hold (or aspire to hold) the following degrees, mostly obtained in parallel:
* Master's degree in Security of Information Technologies, under Jaroslav Sedenka and Martin Stehlik
* Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science, under Peter Wittek
* Master's degree in Theoretical Physics, under Norbert Werner
